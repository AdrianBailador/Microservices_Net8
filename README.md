#Microservices with .NET 8

Building microservices using .NET. We build everything completely from start to finish:

1. Building two .NET Microservices using the REST API pattern.
2. Working with dedicated persistence layers for both services.
3. Deploying our services in a Kubernetes cluster.
4. Employing the API Gateway pattern to route to our services.
5. Creating synchronous messaging between services (HTTP and gRPC).
6. Creating asynchronous messaging between services using an event bus (RabbitMQ).
